# JupyterHub LTI Authenticator

Implements [LTI v1][http://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p1p1/implementation-guide] authenticator for use with JupyterHub.

It's only been tested with [EdX](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/lti_component.html) so far,
but compatibility with other providers is a goal.
